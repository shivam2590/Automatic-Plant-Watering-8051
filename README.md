# Automatic-Plant-Watering-8051
This project can be used as home automation. Even if the garden size is large this project can be implemented easily. Now Garden Owner/User can feed water from any corner of the country. This project is going to feed the water to plants whether the user forgets. This project also conserves the water from wastage. So in water crises, it can be lifesaving. It proves that an embedded system can be useful for saving lives for the upcoming generation.

Here we are using the AT89S52 Microcontroller. We are using its feature like Timers, Interrupts and Serial Communication.
